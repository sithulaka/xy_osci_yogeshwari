# XY Oscilloscope Keyboard Synthesizer

This is a musical keyboard synthesizer that visualizes audio on an XY oscilloscope display, similar to how a real oscilloscope would show Lissajous patterns.

## How to Use

1. Run the application:
   ```
   python oscilloscope_controller.py
   ```

2. Open your browser to http://localhost:8080

3. Play notes using your computer keyboard:
   - The white keys on a piano correspond to: A, S, D, F, G, H, J, K
   - The black keys correspond to: W, E, T, Y, U

4. The oscilloscope display will show the waveform patterns generated by the notes.
